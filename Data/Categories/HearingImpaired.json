    "About_Community": "Hearing impairment is a sensory disability. There are three types of hearing loss: conductive, sensorineural, and mixed. Conductive hearing loss refers to cases where sound is not conducted efficiently through the outer ear canal to the eardrum and the middle ear. Sensorineural hearing loss happens when there is damage to the inner ear (called the cochlea), or to the nerves from the inner ear to the brain. Some people have mixed hearing loss, which means they have both conductive and sensorineural loss in the same ear(s).",
