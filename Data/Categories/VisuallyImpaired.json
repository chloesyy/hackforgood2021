    "About_Community": "Visual impairment ranges from partial vision loss to complete blindness. Blindness is a lack of vision, also known as visual impairment. It may also refer to a loss of vision that cannot be corrected with glasses or contact lenses. Three-quarters of all blindness can be prevented or treated. Partial blindness means that the person has very limited vision. Complete blindness means that the person cannot see anything or has no perception of light. People with a vision worse than 20/200 are considered legally blind.",
